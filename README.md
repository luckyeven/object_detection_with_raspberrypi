# object_detection_with_raspberrypi
 Computer vision with embedded machine learning using raspberry pi 4

## Introduction
This program is part of the CEG4912 project which is designed by **Group 2 of Section F00 for 2021 Fall Term**. Two cameras are used to monitor the EDM.One of the cameras will use an intelligent algorithm to identify the input numbers.The program will send an error signal when any error input is detected. 
## Components
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Pi camera
* USB web camera
## Procedure
1. Collecting Data
2. 
## Documentation
* numPy.py: Conversion between image and array.
## Collection Data
These datas are needed to train the program.
### Dataset Collection Checklist
- [ ] 50 images of the same object for each class
- [ ] 3-4 classes for the problem
- [ ] Shapes will be very different between calsses
- [ ] Scale photos to 96x96 pixels
- [x] Bitmap or PNG format
- [ ] Similar distance, position, lighting, and background
